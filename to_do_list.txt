modifications

lexer:

need to scan the string character by character, not split by spaces.
Token boundaries are: 
1 - Whitespace
2 - Operators: |, <, >, <<, >>
3 - Quotes (' and ")

there are some leaks when using the fucnction init_list

continue working on builtins

handle edge cases 
check leaks in exec and parser
add some comments


Handle exit status
	* need to add correct exit status for signals, and other stuffs
Handle heredocs → <<
	* need to start
Cleanup memory → free tokens & buffers
	* have memory leaks when using pipes 

TEST CASES
	*cat | cat | ls
		- error probably when is closing the fds
	*Try ctrl-\ after running a blocking command like cat without arguments or grep “something“.
		when using this commandd in bash it gives "^\Quit (core dumped)" but in the minishell gives "^\minishell>"
